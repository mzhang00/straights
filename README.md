We’re talking baseball

It’s time to add curves to the graphics engine. Everything will work as before, we will have three more shapes to draw.

    Add the following commands to the parser
        circle: adds a circle to the edge matrix - takes 4 parameters: cx, cy, cz, r
        hermite: adds a hermite curve to the edge matrix - takes 8 parameters: x0, y0, x1, y1, rx0, ry0, rx1, ry1
            The curve is between points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1).
            rx0, ry0 and rx1, ry1 are the rates of change at each endpoint
        bezier: adds a bezier curve to the edge matrix - takes 8 parameters: x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3
            This curve is drawn between (x0, y0) and (x3, y3).
            (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the influence points for the curve.
    For help creating your own image, you might want to use the following graphs:
